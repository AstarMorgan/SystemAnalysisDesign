# SystemAnalysisDesign
# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPAss project was a system designed for drivers who were not doing well on their driving tests at the DMV. The owner, Liam,  wants to create a system that will allow the drivers to gain practice and knowledge outside of doing at the DMV. There they could schedule appointments their appointments themselves onlin eor over the phone with an advisor. The system will support them in studying for the test on and off the road by documenting their written feed back from their instructor. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe what I did well with this project was understandind the client's needs. I think when explaining their business requirements, I grasped what they want from the conversation and was able to to put it together in words for others to understand. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise the system requirements because when it comes to understanding how the system should seamlessly flow together, I think I could put some more time into that part. Such as the classes and methods that are needed to make up the system. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When client asked for it to be easily acessible online and offline, I determined it would be best to be built over the cloud. The user wanted the system to be user friendly and easily manageable. This made it easy to determine that there should be unique usernames and passwords, and also only certain routes that can be created to create and erase a profile. It is important to consider the user's needs because you dont want to do uneccesary work and give the client something they didnt ask for. The design should be simple and easy to manage. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 
When designing software, I think it is important to keep personal opinions out of it. The point in the client trusting you in designing their system is them saying they trust you to take their idea and turn it into what they see in their mind. If you have any ideas, it is best to do everything the client asks for, then suggest it to them if needed. In the future, I plan to write down everything the client is asking for in a list to make sure when I am designing it, nothing is missed.
